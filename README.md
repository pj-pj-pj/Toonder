## Installation & Setup

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Expo CLI (npm install -g expo-cli) -> i dont have this but you can try
- A device/emulator (i used Expo Go)
- Check out expo [docu](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/create-your-first-app/)

### Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```

## How to Build APK/AAB

For an APK (Android installation file):

```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

(i changed android build type in the eas.json file on production)

For an AAB :

```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production --type archive
```

(i think this is for google play and then gp will make the apk for u)

--- btw you need eas account for build

## Limitations

- ❌ Basic messaging flow (no media, images, or voice support).
- ❌ Message limit.
- ❌ A lot more I can't think of right now.
- ❌ Limited amount of exam tries.
- ❌ Store most recent score of exam taken.
- ❌ Feature: make an option to select a toon to chat `randomly`.
